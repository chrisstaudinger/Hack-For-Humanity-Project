# Hacking For Humanity - 36hr Hackathon Project ü§ù

## Overview

This hackathon was a 36 hour event gathering developers, product managers, designers, UXers, sales and marketing professionals to create something that solves a specific problem/s of a partner charity.

I was part of a team of 5 working with SEW (Supporting and Empowering Women) to regain their online prescence.

## Result

Not only did we get a website back up and running to regain their online prescence. We built a production ready ecommerce store, redesigning their customer pipeline to increase efficiency, make running the charity easier and increase sales.

Digging into their organisation deeper, we came up with innovative solutions to increase efficiency and increase their ROI, ultimately being able to impact more lives of opressed Tanzinian women.

Furthermore, we capitalised on their message of the great work they're doing by creating a blog, and marketing strategy to increase their reach and revenue.


### Tech Stack

* CMS (Wordpress)
* Amazon Lightsail

Although it would have been fun to tackle the problem from scratch, it made a lot better business sense for the charity to build using a CMS so they could maintain and update the site and blog through an admin dashoboard without needing to pay a developer. Moreover, they also gained having an ecommerce dashboard for their staff. 


## Sumnary / Conclusion

The hackathon was a huge success and a lot of fun! SEW was extremely greatful and astonished with what we were able to achieve and are/have migrated the site to their own hosting. It was/is a really great feeling knowing that the hard work we put in will be changing the lives of people with less fortunate circumstances üôè
